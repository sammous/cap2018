Findings: - For the 65% in Rio and the 20% in Shanghai:  it is not a 'must buy item due to several factors: Design, Size, Color, Material. - For the one who bought the product,  they were not very enthusiasm about there satisfaction  they thought it was just OK. Conclusions: - Not enough market research were carried out, before launching. - According to general opinion: we have a good idea but a bad execution. - We were not enough aware of the diversity of styles and tastes in different parts of the world. Recommendations: - We should request more research in order to understand better what men want and need in an accessory. - To adapt the product to the consumer, it should be made with leather,  black or white, more sporty and bigger. - As current design doesn't produce much enthusiasm in Asia, some changes could be acceptable too.\r\r\n","level":"A1"}

The result shows us 65 % in Rio de Janeiro and 20% in Shanghai. Theirs reasons are due to several factors: - Design - Size - Color - Material On the other hand, we can see : 20% would buy in Rio de Janeiro and 40% would buy in Shanghai. They are not enterly satisfied. They just think : OK. We find out that the launching has been too fast : not enough market research. The general opinion was good idea but bad execution, also, not enough diversity of styles and tastes comparing what world can offer (they don't want all the same products). To improve the 'Manbag', we should figure out some items as : 1. More research: what men want and need in an accessory. 2. Design: more sporty Size: slightly bigger Colors: strong primary colors; black and white Material: leather 3.

Moreover this lack of resources, he told me that they feel completely under appreciated, and that will not help. I think that we have to address this issue now before the situation deteriorates more and I would like to organize a meeting with Jed, in which we could state the different proposals and make a decision. To prepare this meeting, here are the major solutions we are thinking about : - offer some incentives to increase motivation - recruit 2 other members to get the good staffing - offer overtime and bonuses to those who want to push themselves to achieve the project on the schedule I suggest to organize this meeting very quickly : would friday be available for everyone?

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      The stock index in Hong Kong is called the Hang Seng Index (HSI). During the last year, it has considerably moved. Trying to trace its evolution over the last few month : one year ago, the HSI rose sharply to a high of 27,499. This period was followed by a drop. The index fell to 20,956. After this bad time, it steadily increased (properties and utilities sub-indices have risen dramatically). This rise is due to investment from Mainland China. The experts believe that this increase will continue throughout the next year because of two reasons : - the massive investment from other countries (for example China, which invest a lot in Hong Kong. China is growing very quickly), . the Hong Kong's internal demand. Thus, we can expect a strong and steadily rise of the index at least for the coming year.\r\r\n","level":"A1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      FACTFINDERS Report: Concerning the Sales Figures of the 'Manbag' in Asia and South America.  Introduction: This report was requested by Mr SAMSON, CEO of New line Clothing and Accessories. Its aim is to present clues regarding the counter-performance of sales figures regarding the 'Manbag' in Asia and South America.  Methodology: We interviewed a sample of 1000 persons in Shanghai covering all demographics. We did the same in Rio de Janeiro. These cities were chosen due to the fact they were representing locations able to give a good approach of the whole area.  Findings: - In Shanghai, 80% of the panel approves the product but only 40% would buy. - In Rio de Janeiro, the product was approved by 35% whereas 20% would buy.  > In both cities, the product has not been considered as a &quot;must have&quot; by the people witch disaproved the 'Manbag'. The main factors underlined by these consumers were about the design, the size, the colors and the materials. > The &quot;would buy&quot; interviewees were not enthusiatic. The product was mainly considered as an OK.  > The recognition of the diversity of style and tastes in different parts of the world has been shown.  Conclusions: - Before launching, not enough market research were carried out.%% - The idea seems to be interesting but the execution has to be severely improved. - The product have to be adapted to local market.  Recommendations: 1\/ A stronger market study have to be performed to find out exactly what does the men wants and need. 2\/ Improve the design: - design more sportly - resize the product slightly bigger, - strong primary colors and black &amp; white shall prevail. - change the material to leather 3\/ Adapt the product considering a quote from an interviewee: &quot;going global does not mean we are all the same you know&quot;\r\r\n","level":"A1"}

Furthermore, they have to deal with a lack of ressources because the staff is used by other department too. To top it all, they have the feeling to be underappreciated. We discussed this with Jed and we concluded that things have to change if we don't want to loose the team. We must offer incentive to re-motivate them. I was thinking of offering overtime and bonuses. And to definetly solve the thing, We could recruit a bit to help them.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Oliver Murray has been with Web core for 18 months... Even though it's only 18 months he has been demonstrated high qualities. Therefore I think he's an exemplary star and we should offer him a new position in the department. Firstly he has shown great abilities to integrate the team and take responsibilities on his own shoulders. He was given different projects, and each time I was surprised by his creativity, his accurate analysis, and his willingness to meet the deadlines. Basically, he has managed the last advertising campaign for &quot;ABC&quot; introducing imaginative cost-cutting methods. Although his lack of experience this campaign was a fantastic success for &quot;ABC&quot; and for the company. He's hardworking, with a great involvement for the company, and very reliable. Oliver has also proved that he has leadership skills when he led a small team : he has motivated the people to pull together, to implement new methods, to complete the tasks and meet the goals. For all of these reasons I think that he's an exceptional talent in our organization and I highly recommend him for the position of senior sales executive.\r\r\n","level":"A1"}

Methodology : 1000 persons in each of the two towns were interviewed. The surveys were conducted in Rio de Jameiro and in Shanghai, covering all the demographics and questioned as to their responses to the 'Manbag'. Findings: - In Rio de Janeiro, 35 % approve and 20 % would buy instead of 80% who approve in Shanghai including 40% who would buy. - People who didn't approve explain that it is not a 'must buy' item because of its design, its size, its color or its material. Conclusions: - Results are given after studying only two towns. The research should be carried out in several towns. - People thought that it is a good idea but its realization is bad. - The figures don't reflect the diversity of styles and tastes in the different parts of the world. Recommendations: - The figures need to be studied again and more research should be done about what men want and need in an accessory. - The design should be more sportly, its size slightly bigger, its color strong primary colors (especially black and white), its material leather. - Even if the current design is acceptable for Asia, changes should be realized in this country too.\r\r\n","level":"A1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Concerning the sales figures of the&quot;Manbag&quot;in Asia and South America. Here are the results of the surveys you requested, conducted in Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai. Introduction: The report was requested to compare sales figures market research. Methodology: Sample number were taken for covering all the demographics. 1000 people were interviewed in the both places. Findings: Rio de Janeiro 35% of people approve and 20% would buy 65% not approve. Shanghai: 80% of people approve and 40% would buy (20% not approve) Regarding the disapproval it is not a &quot;must buy&quot; idem due to several factors: Design, size, color, material Regarding the approval who would buy without great enthusiasm though it was &quot;ok&quot; nevertheless they expressed satisfaction. Conclusions: not enough market research were carried out before launching. The general opinion was a good idea but bad execution. The general feeling was that no recognition of the diversity of styles Quote: going global does not mean we are all the same you know. Recommendations: 1. More research: what men want and need in an accessory. 2. Design: more sporty Size: slightly bigger Colors: strong primary colors; black and white Material: leather 3. Changes also acceptable for Asia market as research shows current design is acceptable but not a lot of enthusiasm shown.%%\r\r\n","level":"A1"}

It has been said this morning, that shares of White Space Associate have dropped. The reason would be that our company wasn't up to the challenge. We deny these slanderous reports. White Space beat out 100 others companies to build Mishima Corporation's new HQ in Tokyo and Mr Mishima himself approved of our design. He chose our company - our mission statement of creating harmonious and efficent buildings using all that modern technologycould offer. M Mishima stated that our design fulfilled our own criteria 'beautifully and exquisitely'. Charles Lewis [CEO of Better Homes] should be sure of his facts before making such outrageous and incendiary claims. If his intention was to infect our team with uncertainty then his strategy has backfired in a spectacular fashion. Our advice to Better Homes is this: stick to what you do best.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Report : Concerning the Sales Figures of the 'Manbag' in Asia and South America. Introduction This inquiry was requested by Mr Samson about the Sales Figures of the 'Manbag' in Asia and South America. Methodology For this inquiry, we took a sample number, covering all the demographics and questioned them as to their responses to the Manbag. Findings We had interviewed 1 000 people in Rio de Janiero and  1 000 people in Shangai. As a result for Rio de Janeiro, We had 35% who approved and 65% who not approved. However, on 35% who approved, only 20% of people would buy the 'Manbag'. Concerning Shangai, we had 80% of people who approved and 20% who not approved. 40% of people who approved were interesting to buy the 'Manbag'. For the people who not approve, several factors were considered : Design, size, color and material. Conclusions Not enough market research carried out before lauching. People said : &quot;good idea, bad execution.&quot; Not enough difference about the diversity of styles and states. Recommendations To realize more research about what men want and need in an accessory. To do a design more sporty and size slightly bigger with strong primary colors; black and white.\r\r\n","level":"A1"}

Some reproaches could be made about the timing of these operations. Not enough time was taken to prepare the contents of the leaflets. And for sure the personnel in the civil exercise cell wasn't experienced enough and wasn't enough numerous. It is difficult to deal with three different languages and some mistakes have been done without speaking of the wrong sites used for the dropping.So clearly precautions have to be taken to improve our capacity to lead such missions.- amelioration of the briefings quality- avoid possibility of missunderstanding due to different languages- dead lines to be respected by everyone- scheduled plan with timing for future missionsThank you for your attention.\r\r\n","level":"A1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      White Space Associates Refutes Rivals Claims Since White Space was commissioned, by the Mishima Corporation, to design and construct the Sun Tower financial complex in Japan, it appears that the knives are being sharpened.  In a bold move yesterday afternoon, a rival company stated that our shares prices had dropped. White Space Associates strongly denies this lucubration.  White Space beat out 100 others to build Mishima Corporations new HQ in Tokyo. Mr Mishima himself played a leading role in choosing the winning design.  White Space Associate's proposal was judged as creating harmonious and efficient buildings, using all that modern technology could offer. Furthermore, our design fulfilled all of our client's criteria beautifully and exquisitely.  We are convinced that this claim was issued by one of our competitor. We consider that spreading malicious and unfounded rumors is slanderous. We believe that, before making such outrageous and incendiary claims, facts should be deeply checked. If the intention was to infect our team with uncertainty then this strategy has backfired in a spectacular fashion.  We are primed and ready to build a beautiful and ergonomic building which will bring pleasure to the people who work in it.

Methodology :  Samples of 1000 people covering all the demographics, one in Rio de Janeiro and another one in Shangha,  were questioned as to their responses to the 'manbag'.  Findings:  - The product is not approved by 65% in Rio (vs only 20 in Shangha) - Only 20% would buy in Rio (vs 40% in Shangha) - The main reasons for disapproval are : Design, Size, Color, Material.  Conclusions:  - tastes are different among regions over the world - not enough market research was carried out before launching Recommendations: - do more research about what men want and need in an accessory - Main things to change for Manbag in South America are :  - a more sporty design,  - a slighty bigger size - strong primary colors and B&amp;W - leather as best material\r\r\n","level":"A1"}

I already propose to offer some incentives, overtime and bonuses at the end of the project. We should hire some more people to extend the team of the services who borrow the members of this team.

Second, thanks to his reliable personality, we are sure that people could follow him and trust him, what is really important. Third, he is SEXY ; that was important for you, wasn't it!%% And we think that, as he didn't play for a long time, he should ask us a lot of money!

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      White Space Associates Refutes Rival's Claims In a bold move yesterday afternoon, White Space Associates denied claims from a rival company that shares prices had dropped. In fact, White Space beat out 100 others to build Mishima Corporation's new HQ in Tokyo. Mr Mishima himself played a leading role in choosing the winning design. Mr Mishima chose White Space citing White Space Associate's mission statement of creating harmonious and efficient buildings using all that modern technology could offer. Mr Mishima stated that White Space's design fulfilled their own criteria 'beautifully and exquisitely'. These claims were made by Charles Lewis, CEO of Better Homes. He also said White Space wasn't up to the challenge. The CEO of White Space Associates appeared on the steps in front of the company's HQ and accused Mr Lewis of spreading 'malicious and unfounded rumors'. &quot;Since White Space was commissioned, by the Mishima Corporation, to design and construct the Sun Tower financial complex in Japan, it appears that the knives are being sharpened. Charles Lewis [CEO of Better Homes] should be sure of his facts before making such outrageous and incendiary claims. If his intention was to infect my team with uncertainty then his strategy has backfired in a spectacular fashion. White Space Associates are primed and ready. Our designs have been approved by Mr Mishima himself and we are ready to build a beautiful and ergonomic building which will bring pleasure to the people who work in it. My advice to Better Homes is this : stick to what you do best. Meanwhile White Space will continue to do what we do best, building for the future'.\r\r\n","level":"A1"}
