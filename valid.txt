Obviously, I like watching movies from different nations such as Japanese or American movies. But our movies are unique. It's not a question about the plot, our movies can be funny, inspiring, sad. It's not a question about actors or actresses, even if we have loads of good and charismatic actors. It's not a question about the budget of the movie, compared with Americans our film directors are broke. It's just the fact that French directors likes to describe very accurately mankind's behaviour. We like to focus on the traits of our characters, their strengths, their weaknesses, their defaults. Finally, we like to show in our movies how human is. It's very important for us to show that people can be totally different but despite this they share the same feelings, the same difficulties. Maybe you think our movies are boring or not so exciting than an action movie or a thriller, but our flicks are speaking about a very important thing: people like you and me.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

They really heart the atmosphere and mess up the city. These kind of companies have a great responsibility to society.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Well, green business, I think, is an important thing. From the end of the XXth century, people start realizing that green products are important and can help us to reduce or limited the global warming. But we also must be aware of what is going on behind this business : some companies are willing to lie to consumers to make them buy their products, even if they are not really &quot;green&quot;. I think that we must give a more important part to green products in our lives, and even go out of our way to buy some, if we think it is useful and even if it is more expansive, for products such as cleaning ones, we can pay a little extra cost because we don't buy them everydays. So yes, maybe, if we start to buy green products to replace those we don't use often and which also are toxics, we could change things and habits for our children and future generations.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}
{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      I am surprised at how violence and sex scenes are more and more common in TV shows today. I find that sex and violence are now too often trivialized. For example, some famous police dramas show all the details of people getting kicked and murdered. There are also numerous documentaries in the news showing scenes of violence and riots. In movies and TV shows, sex scenes are now very detailed and realistic. The sex on TV is no longer implied as it was there are several years before.  I think that it is not good for young people because they generally use what they see on TV as a reference. Fortunately, there are also good educational programs on TV. In my opinion, it is very important to choose properly the programs that we watch on TV and to not allow young people to watch all they want.\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      On this line graph from 2004 to 2008, the first think to keep in mind is that if the National sales figures were lower up to mild 2006, we are very glad to notice that, since the end of this year 2006, our increase of books sales has been bigger than it does in the rest of the world. We can see, with pleasure, that our country, always, loves reading if, however we can show in bookshops and libraries, valuable books either novels, essays biographies, or technical publications. Since 2006 we were fortunate, to have many successful tittles, I don't want to name them, but anybody could guess. These many successes with highest sales have allowed national book industry to recover his natural level. But it's often difficult having many exceptional best-sellers, so, since the middle of 2007 we can notice a sharp decrease, what, however, sounds to be slowing down with the arrival to the national reading people of these two novels that met and meets still a phenomenal succes. We are confident for the future. Good reading to anybody. This was the speech from Mrs Booking President of National Readers Association, on 22nd of May 2008.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Paris has always been a culture leader. Paris has played a fabulous role in the spread of classical music or painting in the early XXs. Nowadays, people agree that New -York is the most creative place around the world. Consequently, English plays a major role in world culture and for this reason I find it useful to know English. I remember I was completely useless at languages when I was in school and I might have learnt English later. As classical musician and during my concerts in Europe, it became obvious that I need English to navigate the musical world. Speaking with manager, organizing with records company, travelling abroad, there was many reasons to understand English. This language not only leads to better job opportunities but to a better life in general.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Nowadays in French society, equality between men and women is still an issue. Despite a lot of improvement in the last thirty years, there's still a lot of work to do for a real equality. For instance, men are better off women in terms of salary, position, respect. Why aren't we able to settle a real equality in our society ? In my opinion, works in general play a big role in this situation. But for women, in their carreer, there's the problem of their pregnancy. Because of that, they can't reach good position or have a good promotion. Everytime, before hiring or promoting a woman, firms always think about that. Could they be totally available for the compagny ? Could they cope with all the responsibilities ? Then, there's a lot of men running the highest position in compagny. Like that they continue to hire or promote men instead of women.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

However, I am not much into this style. As you can see, the whole melody doesn't have a wide range except two or three high notes in chorus. I mean, it's not a melody that someone could die for.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      A lot of businesses exist simply to make money. There are others who seriously which to provide a needed service to a community or to the world. Each of these businesses has a corporate responsibility to the public, its shareholders and the world it trades in. Years ago, a company corporate responsibility was dictated by its government. Today, however, corporate responsibility has to take into account the world that we live in on a much wider scale. The public has become much more globally aware, and there are a number of groups that monitor corporations closely. These groups have the conditions of the world in mind. They think about the social issues of the world, such as labor laws and the exploitation of workers. They are also concerned with environmental issues, such as the rainforests disappearing. Large global companies know that people are watching them and that any wrongdoing will not go unnoticed. Personnally, I think companies must have a social conscience, treat employees fairly and try to do the best for their shareholders while trying to be socially responsible. Corporate responsibility has a huge impact on the local community, but also on the world. Bad and good corporate responsibility has effects that reach from the worker in the third world country to the air that we breathe.%%\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

It consists to  convert  the energy of the oceans in electricity. It is environmentaly-friendly .Hydroelectricity can be use too. It's a little bit more expensive. They use the gravitional force of the river.After that you have wind power. The cost is more important and it is necessary to have a strong wind .At the end  we have solar power. You must have a lot of money because you have a high installation costs and you must have a lot of sun .

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      To create a successful project and solid teamwork, I propose that companies use the SWOT analysis technique. SWOT helps a business evaluate internal and external strenghts, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Let's say you carry out a SWOT analysis at the beginning of a project. The first thing is to make sure that project goals are clear. Then, I'd say you should make a list of questions to satisfy each element of the SWOT analysis. You want to make sure all the major project tasks are covered and identify possible risks. My thought then would be to take SWOT even further. Team members could collaborate on a SWOT analysis of the team itself, making them a stronger team and developing mutual trust. For example, if the team spends time identifying their strengths, then the resulting information can actually motivate the team. And, as they identify weaknesses, they become more aware of how to prevent future problems. Once you complete a SWOT analysis, I suggest that you review it frequently. Change the questions and answers as the market changes, and focus on taking advantage of your strengths and opportunities and reducing your weaknesses and threats.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Moreover, 69 percent of women prefer magazine to blogs.Similarly, 72 percent of men prefer magazines, but much more these ones which included extensive knowledge on website. Furthermore, 47 percent purchase at lease one magazine a month.There are several competitive products, for the first group, six competitive products already exist. In comparison, there is only a long term one for men, and two recent competitive products.On the one hand, a product renown it's a good thing, but on the other hand to have several competitive products allow us to make the right choice.In 2010, the first group has a large purchasing power.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      According to me, the Internet is one of the most important technological revolutions these last years. It has really affected my way of life. You can quickly access information in various areas, such as literature, philosophy, history, and music. Do you miss your best friend who lives halfway around the world? Don't worry, you can do video chat so that you can see him. You need to improve your English but you are busy and can't take night classes? You can study online whenever you want. You can purchase anything you need, making good bargains. Of course, there are also drawbacks:  your boss can expect you to work at home for example. You may be supposed to be always available. One of the main downsides of the Internet is that people spend too much time in front of their computer, forgetting to talk to their family. They are completely engrossed in their screen as if their life happened inside. Despite these drawbacks, I cant help thinking that the internet is a wonderful tool which makes your life easier. On the other side, I dont understand the growing interest in products like smartphones. Is it really useful to have so many features?%% For example, if someone sends me an email, is it so dramatic if I dont see it right now? I think that smartphone is far from its initial aim and that it is just a gadget.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Nowadays management and colaboration are a huge part of the work. To work efficently, you company need a elaborate organisation. I will dwell on few ways required to manage a project. First and foremost, a project need an organisation and a leader. The leader will set up all the management. Without a leader, making a decision will need the entire group's acceptation, which will waste lot of time. Then, a teamwork need meeting. These meetings will not only be used to resolving problem but also dividing tasks between the employees. I advise you to schedule the next meeting in the end of each appointement. It set up a deadline. These meeting can also become a brainstorming. It is more efficient to think as a group than just one. Besides people need time to work alone on their tasks. That is why meetings have to be not too often. When people have so much meetings, they pay less attention in that and the meeting becomes inefficient. On the whole, to make a good teamwork, you need just two things. The first is a leader and the second is dividing correctly the time work between meeting and alone-work.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

TV would never show how world is great sometimes, they rather show us how violent and crazy people can be anywhere in this world but all that is very well organized by the media who need to sell and capture the audience instead of giving support and educate people, they rather scary you so you become so dependent on it and give you commercial entertaining that don't make you think that where you're is the best place in the world because the rest of the world is so scary that you don't need to get up and travel in it. If I would watch a TV program, I will always watch the news in three different continents. For example, I start with BBC, TV 5 Monde and China news. At least, I don't have same news and the Asian Channel is always positive and entertaining.

I had got the idea of creating this organisation following a training: I was intern in a big corporation that was going to close. The staff decided to help people to find a new job. It was an American society and the organisation was amazing. Most workers had no skills and they were quiet a lot. We worked in two directions: towards the firms and towards the people. We tried to make them confident and optimistic. We prepared them to job interviews, to use their strength and recognize their weaknesses. At the same time, one person of our team spent all day long on the phone, getting in touch with other companies to know if they were susceptible to hire people. We also prepared what we called 'profiles' of these people. it was a short portrait, no more than five lines and we sent them. If we got appointments, the D day, the boss took these persons in his car, he checked their look (their tie, neatness etc.) and waited for them until the end of their meeting.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      I had never attended to an opera because I was just not into it and I thought that the singers were always over-the-top and even sometimes ridiculous. However, I happened to be present at one representation of a Puccini's opera: Mrs Butterfly. I must confess that I was a little bit reluctant, but I wanted to please my wife who is fond of operas, and I don't regret now. As soon as the drop cloth raised and the conductor began to direct the orchestra, magic overcame me. The story takes place in Japan, and the sets were so much wonderful and adapted than I felt like if I had been in Tokyo, at the former century. As for the plot, it was deeply stirring: Mrs Butterfly had been seduced by an American officer, who returned alone in his country. She has been waiting for him for three years, but, when he comes back, he has married another woman and he wants to take the child he conceived with Mrs Butterfly. Then, she commits suicide. Plus, the quality of the voices was breathtaking and Puccini's music significantly increased the strength of the emotion! In a nutshell, I discovered a masterpiece and a performing art that I am fan of now.%%\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

He should be capable of leading his followers. Efficient leadership involves guiding the followers in the right direction, helping them attain the intented goal. Words are effective only if accompanied by actions. So the leader must set an example for his followers through his own life and actions. You must also know your people. You need to make selections, delegate responsabilities and choose worthy people to implement your decisions. Understanding the potential of your people is important. To be a good leader, one must always remember that he is leading people. It is the people who make him the leader by following him. It is unjust to pay no heed to what the followers want. You need to be understanding and considerate with people. You need to help them fight their weaknesses, laud their strenghs and take them along on the path of success.%%\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

The entire cruise arranged by your company was terrible and it was not like you quote on your advertise. First, the ship wasn't new and it wasn't a cruise ship, in fact it was a horrible little boat. The cabin was dirty and full of ants and bathrooms was disgusting. Then, the captain was unfriendly and unprofessional. He often woke up late. Finally, I didn't see most of the animals they were promised and there were extra hidden charges. In all, your advertise was misleading.Sincerely,Mike Jersy\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      In france, there are striking differences between men and women. On one hand, women became more feminist than before but the society didn't change really. For example, researches said there are more men who become CEo than women. An other example is the law about an equal number of men and women in big companies' boards of director. Moreove, men earned more than women for the same work. This difference can be explained by the position of the woman in the family. In principle, as at the beginner of the 1900s, she has family duties like about the cook, the kids... One of my teacher said me a short story about a man and and a woman who are mrried and did the same job, lawyer. He said that the woman woke up sooner than her husband. She prepared little for kids for school and she went to work. Her husband at the time is at home, is taking his breakfast... All the day is like this.

First of all, I want to let you know this is totally the job for you, I mean you'd work outdoor sharing a great contact with animals daily. I guess working as a Zookeeper must be an exhilarating and exciting job, so i urge you to just go for it. Make a bid and you'll see. Plus, it's by far the most well paid job i've seen in the ads including one month holiday every year and a full accident insurance, you won't have to worry giving them one of your finger for the desert.

Rich or poor, any student should be able to take part to all educational activities.  Our old school is sad and old-fashionned. The study conditions are not optimal, as you know. I will convince the Principal to raise funds to give the premises a more modern and smiling aspect. That would be to the benefit of all of us, including the Professors. The restaurant issues will also be considered. By using the services of an external catering company, we could offer better means for not more than the current price.  The Students bedrooms should be refreshed and modernized. I have studied the cost impact of such improvements, and I tell you that that could be done without affecting the global fare. If you also think that our School needs to be modernized, vote for me for President next Friday.%% I count on all of you.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

I know that it is not easy to deal about that but thrust in me, a medical assistance could help you. I well know that because I have had this phobia when I was young and this way of treatment allowed me to overcome this fear. I hope these few words will help you. I hope to see you soon.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      English became an important language in my life. When I was young, I didn't see how it could be and how it will be important for me. English was just a lecture like another. It was boring for me to learn irregulary verbs, and doing grammar. I had preferred studying sciences, thinking it was more useful. But when I grew up, I realised that I was missing something and I was needing english. First, I became passionate by travels. Communicate with people or others travellers is useful when you travel but also very mind-expanding. Subsequently, I started my master's degree in trade and marketing with a mandatory speciality: international. Within business and economy area, english is playing a major role, so, if I wanted to continue my career in this way, I had to learn and improve this language. Learning english is not easy, quick and efficient by following lectures in France...So, I decided to pack and flight to USA for few months, to work and lean directly within an english country. Then, I have down my studies in Ireland. Gradually, I became better. English needs to be practice everyday. I cannot do it at work, so, I travel when I can, I watch my movies or series in original version, and I improve it on englishtown.%%fr! ;)\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Then, why it was registered on Unesco's universal heritage of humanity list ? Because Marrakach is known by one famous place named &quot;Djemaa el-Fna square&quot; where there is an open-air performing art every day that's unique not only to the country but in the world. Djemaa el-Fna owes most of its fame to the large number of spectacles going on all around all the time. Snake charmers, singers, story tellers, healers and fakirs attract Moroccan and tourist audience. After dusk, when most of the daytime vendors pack up, the square becomes alive with musicians playing drums, mandolins, flutes, and a variety of other instruments. In particular, listen to a performance of Gnaoua , a Moroccan-bred genre of trance music that combines many African styles. At night, the square becomes a big open-air restaurant giving an unique and fantastic ambiance. it's always croweded. That's why Djemaa el-Fna square is the beating heart of Marrakach that offering an unique performing art that I have never seen somewhere else.%%\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Like this, he can see you express your surprise and joy. If your are an Asian, from Japan or China for example, you have to take the gift, say thank you, put it somewhere out of the view, and, overall, not open it beside your donor. Like this, you don't have to show any feeling, surprise or delight. For us, Europeans, that weird manner is misunderstandable.

To protect the inner village, the ramparts were built over the outer wall of the houses that circle the main square. These outer walls were initially build without window nor opening to prevent any intrusion. Nowdays, the village is more open and all the facades show some nice and pleasant openings in the style of the &quot;Provence&quot; or &quot;Lubron&quot;. The tallest building is the church, settled in the middle of the village, with a spire made of colored ceramics.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      First of all, I think you should change your lifestyle and cut back on unnecessary spending on food. Not only to save money, but also to be in good health. On the one hand you must reach a compromise, but on the other hand I insist on the fact that you don't have to reduce everything, otherwise that will get you in a bad mood. The first thing you must do is to wake up earlier and drink your coffee at home, before going at work. In addition, that might be a good idea to cook all your meals by yourself instead of buying precooked ones, that won't cost you an arm and a leg. Although I agree it's important to spend good time with friends after work, once a week is enough. Therefore, I'll suggest you to meet them on Friday, if you really want to be careful with your money. Moreover, you should be honest with them.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Is France the real country of the equal rights, especially for women? Here is a difficult question. Even if the society has evoluated during the last century, there still are some differencies between the roles of men and women. The main difference is at work. Some high jobs are more accessibles for men than for women. But now, companies try to integrate more women. But we have to understand that working women are recent. One or two centuries ago, women used to rest at home, take care of the family, make shores and cook. But, in politic, women are integrated to the system. For example, Marine le Pen, Martine Aubry, Roselyne Bachelot or Ccile Duflot have a great influence on the French politic. But, can we say that the gender equatily is total? It is still an open question.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

If you are invited be punctual. You are not obliged to bring a present but you may bring wine or flowers if you want.Be smiling and listening. Lean towards people when they are talking to you.

She has been the first woman to access this position. I work in the same company, I am a planner. Every day I give instructions about the way the production should pass off. I have a lot of responsibilities. Sometimes, I ask myself &quot;Have women a smaller brain than men?&quot;; It could explain why women are poorly paid... Even though some men are beginning to help women for the domestics's tasks, it isn't a common behaviour.

I heard that your resignation was motivated by the relocation of the company and because you suffer from claustrophobia, it was too hard for you to adapt to the new situation. I have a close friend who also suffered during a long time from claustrophobia and I saw how it affected his personal and his professional life. Whenever he was staying in an enclosed space, he would feel anxious and start panicking, staying close to exit doors. Because of his phobia, he used to avoid taking airplanes or going to crowded rooms. Going to his workplace was a big problem because he couldn't take the subway, not to mention using an elevator, whereas his first job was located on top of a tower so he had to give up on it soon after he started.%% His symptoms included breathing problems, sweating and his heart would start racing. Fortunately, he succeeding in overcoming his phobia by following a treatment which combined CBT and hypnosis and he leads now a normal life. I would advise you visit the doctor who helped him cure his claustrophobia. During his medical sessions, he was asked to visit claustrophobic situations but he was accompanied by his doctor who helped him feel as safe as possible, practicing at the same time relaxation techniques with him. Moreover, hypnosis helped him to identify what triggered originally his claustrophobia and thus to inactivate his mechanisms of panic. I assure you these can really help in times of panic and anxiety. I wish you best of luck and if you ever need to talk to someone, please feel free to contact me.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Adapted from the comic book wrote by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd, it sets in a future UK after a nuclear war which have been letting the US and the rest of Europa in a very bad shape. Only the despotic England leads the world with the same methods than the facists during the second world war. Only one man, V ( Hugo Wearing), who at first is a victim, decides to rebel against the system, takes revenge and tries to destroy it. The rythm of the movie, leading actors, supporting actors, special effects and even the main music theme ( The Overture 1819 of Tchaikovsky) are here to lead the movie to the excellence.

It is a film adaptation loosely inspired by the 1820 short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; by Washington Irving and stars Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. The plot follows police constable Ichabod Crane (Depp) sent from New York City to investigate a series of murders in the village of Sleepy Hollow by a mysterious Headless Horseman.

For example the Italiens are the ones which speak with theirs hands; they can't talk to you without them. For them it's also common to call me with my first name and to put a hand on my shoulder as if they know me since a long time. I like them because they are sympatic, even if I am not appreciating physical contact. I prefer their behavior to the North German's who are too cold for me. You have to worm information out of them.

After my A-level,  I've stopped English for two years but I think it was a mistake because now I really need English in my professionnal life. Indeed, someone who speaks English can have a better salary than someone who doesn't. Moreover I would like to finish my studies with a master in the UK and therefore I need to have the toefl IBT with about 110\/120.

It's good for any kind of nausea like travel sickness or morning sickness.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Dear Teacher, It seems to be difficult for me to speak about office relationship. Of course I have some difficulty to have or to understand the perfect behaviour. I work into the customer company as a consultant since 2004. NeedIess to say that office politics is harder for a consultant than for a coworker. Obviously the customer will be jealous because he will think that the consultant is well paid, more clever and more respected for the quality of his job. As a result severals customers will try to convince the consultant to go away by using a misbehavior. Moreover office politics will be quite different when you work with a customer or a coworker. The perfect office politics would be for me to smille, to joke, to avoid to criticize others and to be hypocrite whatever the circumstances. Now, I try to think that I am in a coctail party, to be patient, to be comprehensive and to use my sens of humor. It seems to be efficient but a little bit to late. I will leave this customer with a positive attitude, happy to show my expertise to my new customer. Best regards\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Dear John, we have selected an ad campaign for Century watches. I'm sure you will love our choice of campaigns. Many people think that Century is a classic and well-known brand because it has featured some of the most famous stars in advertising campaigns. While this might true, it is also true that customers prefer Century because it is simply the best and most reliable watch maker on the market. That is the reason why Century has managed to be one of the top three watchmakers world wide. Considering Century's end of working with famous stars, we contemplated the idea of bringing a ccelebrity into the campaign. We decided, however, that the quality of the watch was more important than celebrity endorsement. For this reason, we decided that the ad would feature a man playing golf, simple and crystal clear but with a slogan that delivers an efficient meassage. A message not directed to stars and athletes, but directed to each and every man that will. Read and look at our ad.  Golf and Century. The perfect team is a simple message that everyone can understand.%% And that is why our ad will succeed and still follow Century's style. When you consider thT our ad will feature a common man playing golf, you might think it is tha wrong choice. However, the secret of our campaign relies on the fact that this man will still inspire taste and elegance.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

Each bottle knocked down corresponds to a point. If all the bottles are knocked down, the players can play againt. The winner is the player with  most points after ten turns.\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      In my faraway country you can find plenty of strange buildings, traditional and modern, pink, red and yellow skyscrapers with funny windows, and huge main entrances.  My country, located in the planet X2.0, is famous for housing the tallest skyscraper of the Universe. This skyscraper called as the MONSTER is more than 10 000 of height from the sidewalk  without taking into account flagpole, functional structures as the antenna that reaches more than 30 meters. The Monster's architectural height is so fascinating that people are coming all around the Universe to visit it. From the sidewalk you can't even see the top of the building, and you've have that strange feeling that the all building is moving slowly from one side to another.  You can find also more traditional buildings, smaller but more welcoming and warming making of vibrant british red bricks. Since humanity decided to shift towards more renewable energy and eco-frendly infrastructures, in my country you'll find buildings covered by  solar panel, with organic garden on the roof. Nowadays some of the buildings are self-governing using photosynthesis energy. Well to conclude in my word, every buildings deserve to be visited.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

Green business became an excellent business for some lobbies. Lets have a look on wind power for example.  Its main quality is that it is renewable. In the name of this superiority to fossil fuels, we are supposed to forget a few drawbacks. Is it consistent? No. Is it storable? No. Is it pleasant to live near a wind turbine?  No. Does it embellish our landscape? No. How many birds are killed thanks to these windmills? Last but not least: how much does it cost really? In France, it is very interesting to get its own windmill because EDF  is compelled to buy your electricity a good price and who pays the bill? Certainly not the wind companies which are the great winners of the operation! When I hear the nice people in their boat talking about paper towels, I am not surprised, just a little disappointed.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Dear Paula, I'm going to explain whatever you could do or avoid to save on money. Incidentally, the best way to eat properly. At first, you don't need to starve about food or coffee for not spending money, especially before your work. Likewise, the invaluable possibility to keep your lunch time as well to break the tough day with a healthy dish. Unfortunately, increasingly active people eating junk food faster, not either they don't care about their wallet. Don't fallen in the trap! To begin, it would be preferable to take away a flask with your own coffee inside. It might be cheaper for you, anyway Look up on the internet to find the recipe of good latte coffee drink. The day before, cooking a fresh salad with vegetables and chicken then take away for the lunch. If you're drying up about money, you mustn't come out into fancy restaurant in the evening. Talking about your situation to your friends. If they're sympathetic people, so they will understand. Finally, launch to them a fancy-dress ball with a tremendous pasta party!\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Buildings in France are an amazing blend of modern and traditional architecture. For example in Paris, you can admire the Louvre Palace which was built in the 12th century.The main building and its two wings are made of light yellow stones. They are surrounding a strange glass design reminding of a greenhouse without tomatoes : the Louvre Pyramid. Even if you are modern design friendly, you can't prevent from avoiding walking past it. In the heart of the city, when going for a walk, you can go past the big Hausmann buildings. Even if those rough apartment houses belongs to a luxurious era, they are lacking of refinement. In the same way, the skyscrapers in La Defense area are not very attractive. Considering the crowding of buildings,  the place I prefer in Paris is certainly the Trocadero Esplanade, a large area without any buildings, only some gardens and a few fountains. A place where you can stroll and rest from the crushing presence of the overwhelming buildings.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

Before I outline the sections of my presentation, here's an interesting fact. Did you know that there are different kinds of controllers ? So, with that in mind, my presentation will be split into three parts. Firstly, I'm going to deal with all controlling areas such as financial analysis, business analysis, operational controls, HR controls, and so on.

Then, all of a sudden, everything was calm. The calm lasted for about 50 minutes, and then the earth began again to tremble. I was very afraid.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      What makes a successful leader is hard to define. Take me, for example. Most of my adult life I was more of a follower than a leader. I've always had a hard time persuading others, and I lack most of the characteristics that we associate with a strong leader, like charisma and drive. It wasn't until five years ago, when I was hired by a new company and ended up in a management training course, that things began to change for me. At first, I thought I would never be able to develop leadership qualities. Among the biggest challenges for me was just feeling comfortable in front of a large group. But the leader of course earned my trust and, before I knew it, I was being asked to help others. Now I'm the manager of my department, and my boss is very happy with my performance. I don't think I'm the best leader in the world, but my staff respects me and I feel confident. The most important thing that I've learned is this : Never underestimate yourself.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Following your request, please find hereafter the reasons I decided to subscribe  such a learning program:* I want to study online because I think it's the most flexible way to improve my English. Indeed, between my job and my family it's a little bit difficult to regularly follow conventional training in face to face. You can adapt  your learning program with your schedule. * I would like to study the oral comprehension in order to be confortable when I have to discuss with other people. More I want to improve my fluency because I would like to expand my level of responsibility in my company and more especially to manage foreign people. Business management and sales situations are both of my main subjects of work but it could be interessting to have knowledge in different other areas.* I want to reach a high level of autonomy in English and  good competencies in grammar\/vocabulary.I remain at your disposal if you need further information about my motivation.Best regardsCM\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

Indeed, the BSC is composed by 4 axes which are the guarantor of the membership of everybody in the company : there is a financial axis, a customer axis, an axis organizational process and a dedicated axis for learning and growth. Thanks to this 4 axes, the financial axis will play a less important role whereas the stakeholders could express their voices! For example, employees will pick up data during their day to day worklife and will give their feedback about what are company's strengths and weaknesses. In the same way, the customer will have the opportunity to express their wishes and desires. Moreover, all the data collected will be automatically sent to the company data base and the BSC in order to be sort and thereby help the top management to make the right decision taking in consideration all the actors of the company.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

I love movies, and as Paris is a town with many theaters, I try to see as many films as possible. I can visit friends, attend workshop (a writng one), help my daughter in law and my son to look after my grandson. That is my favourite activity ! Travelling is not really our dream except, in my opinion, if we can meet really people, which means, for me, work with them as I did in the past. However, we decided to visit Brazil, a small part of Brazil. It was quite interesting but, in spite of our efforts to learn portuguese, it was not enough to get to know people. We have had another experience in the States. A satisfying one because we met American people in Paris, became friends, invited them and were invited in return. That's what I really enjoy.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      I began to learn English a year ago when I was twenty two years old. I went to New York for three months and studied in an international school. This experience totally changed my life because I met people from all around the world and was able to discuss with them about different topics. At this moment, my way to analyze the world totally changed even my political beliefs. It was amazing ! I truly think that I am not at all the same person since I began to communicate with people from Brazil, Japan, Africa, etc. However, English had an other important role in my professional life. As a matter of fact, I had a lot of opportunities because I am an English speaker. In my country especially in my work it is really important to be completely fluent because we are always working with other nationalities. Furthermore, English make me become more ambitious, hoping an international career. Before, I was thinking to show my artistic work only in France. Now, my goal is to move overseas to touch the heart of 7 billions people. In concluding, I'll be all my life grateful to the woman who push me to learn this language that I hated so much two years ago.%%\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Of course, all of those tips don't come directly, and most of people are not born with manager skills. But more and more companies are willing to offer to their managers some training courses. With those courses, managers learn the most important skills they will need to drive efficiently a team.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Down by the river It was Inspector Mike Clint's day off and as usual, early in the morning, when the city was still quiet, he enjoyed going down for a walk to buy cigarettes or the newspaper. Even tough the sun had just risen, he could easily tell it would be another scorching day in Jackson, Mississippi. Clint was strolling down Main Street when his attention was drawn to the newspapers. They all read the same headline : &quot;Oil tycoon James Tyler found dead&quot;. The article mentioned the 90-year-old-magnat had been found bleeding to death in the lobby of his luxurious mansion in Jackson by his gardener, Joseph Conty, who had been working there for 40 years. Clint jumped into his old chevrolet and hurried to his office. Joseph was being interrogated by his colleagues. The old man had been killed with a sharp object such as a knife or a huge scissor, both of which could be found in the Black employee's toolbox. Clint knew Joseph, a kind, honest, trustworthy man...but he also knew how White justice worked in the Deep South. Racial tensions were like embers on a fire, ready to spark off with the slightest breeze. Especially since the murder of MLK a few months earlier. His colleagues were talking Joseph into confessing his crime, that he had killed Tyler to steal him 500 dollars before calling 911. Clint took over and quickly pointed out some inconsistencies in his colleagues' report. Why did County receive a phone call on that very night, urging him to go into Tyler's mansion? Who called him ? Someone surely needed him to be there. One of his scissors had been missing for a few days. Who took the possible murder weapon? How come County found 500 dollars in his toolbox? The employee was devastated by his boss' death. Clint investigated the magnificent two-story-house, with an impressive entrance staircase and noticed a few missing objects on the wall of the luxuriously decorated interior. He went on to question Tyler's close employees. John Reif, Tyler's so-called right hand man, watched Clint stepping out of his car, took an emeraud incrusted dagger out of his bag, looked at the blade stained with blood,an evil smile on his face and put it carefully in a locked drawer... There was a knock at the door. -&quot;Come in, Inspector&quot; NB : I'm sorry, I know I didn't respect the number of words but I don't understand how it's possible to write a murder essay with 150 words... Maybe I didn't quite understand what was meant by the term &quot;entry&quot;. I look forward to reading to your answer. Will I be able to start again ? Thanks for your help.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

They also have electronic educative games that helps them to stimulate memory and curiosity to learn. In Morocco, each student have to transport on his back daily around 14 kg of books, and once he get to schools, he must search for a place to sit down among the large numbre of students (first challenge) and then listen to the teacher.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      The Company IXW wants to upgrade their computers. They need two different models. 35 units of a standard type, and 15 units of a very performing computer. It seems there is no problem with the price of the latter one, even if it is quite expensive, but they want a bulk discount on the 35 units.  However, the vendor is not ready to make a discount for so few units. They are in a deadlock. Then, the vendor makes a counterproposal. She suggests that they buy another model than what they had initially selected. The computer would be a bit slower, but its price would enter in IXW's budget. They can make the prices work. The representative's boss confirms her proposal. They all agree about the payment terms and the maintenance conditions. It is a win-win agreement. The two parties are happy.\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

Having studied at the Universities and at a &quot;Grande Ecole&quot;, I should have been able to tell clearly about it. But some didn't catch it because it's a little bit strange concept that doesn't exist abroad. Similarly, universities and &quot;Grandes Ecoles&quot; are teaching places which provide means for graduating. The main difference is that everyone is allowed to go to university, regardless of his school curriculum. Conversely to go to a Grande Ecole, you have to pass a very demanding exam which a lot fail. So the best students go to Grandes Ecoles&quot; But unlike university, after having been selected, courses are very easy and there is time left to have fun without studying too hard. This different ways have both their advantages and drawback. The main problem is that it influences the whole professional life. The best jobs are, in fact, reserved for &quot;Grandes Ecoles&quot;.

The ship was not a cruise ship: it was old, small, uncomfortable, dirty and very slow. It even had an engine problem and we had to stop for half a day. The captain was very unfriendly and unprofessional. We saw only few animals instead of number of them promised in your ad. Finally, it should not have any extra charges, but there were.

This movie try to show us how someone can be victim of injustice and can succeed despite of very bad conditions in prison life. But the important thing that this movie reveals, in my opinion, is the possibility for justice to make a great errors of judgments and how it can destroys sometimes the life of someone who is not guilty. This movie was also a big success because the actors were really fantastic and had played their role perfectly .\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

For example, the TF1 channel shows The Mentalist on tuesdays, Eprits Criminels on wednesdays and The Experts (Manhattan or Miami) each thirsday and saturday ! Knowing that this program is only for one channel is scary ! Moreover, I think there's more and more sex scenes in the movies. Consequently, it's very difficult to protect our children from it.

In 2005 it is the same, but there, you can also see that the blackline stops to increase and it begins to drop just a little bit.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      I understand laws about tobacco and alcohol. I reckon that the State must care for the health of the citizens. However, unlike drugs, the State makes a lot of money with the trade of alcohol and tobacco. And it's why, from my point of view,  the laws are sometimes ridiculous. Here in France, as far as tobacco goes, for example, all the cigarette boxes have to show a notice reading in bold letters that smoking kills, and they must also wear a picture about the damages caused to health by tobacco. Do you think that the addicted smokers look at these warnings ? From an economical point of view, since 75% of the price of a box are taxes, what would happen if every smoker gave up tomorrow ? Non smoking would kill the State, yes ? And where would France go with no more wine drinkers ? Nevertheless, a law obliges any person on the radio or TV, who only pronounces a word like &quot;wine&quot; or &quot;beer&quot;, to immediately add &quot;to be used moderately, of course&quot;.It sounds slightly childish, doesn't it ? And do you think that such an advice would prevent any drunkard from having a shot too many ? I don't think so.%%..\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Dear Mr Righter, Following your last email, I'm glad to send you the reasons of my application. Why I want to study online: It's mostly because of the flexibility it offers. I'm working to a tight schedule, so I can't afford to be in a normal school with fixed tuition. Also, I feel well with new technologies, so the combinaison of these two reasons made me make out that choice. Subjects I would like to study: I was going to study on how the bees communicate with each other, then I realized studying English could be a better choice for my professionnal life. And then, who knows ? Maybe even bees are talking english to communicate. What I hope to achieve with an online study program: I do think the technologies are now mature enought to provide a real & efficient learning environment. I'm considering achieving a complete tuition, and I would like to know if your online program delivers certificates. My aim is divided into two parts: self-development and professional advancement. I want to go up on the ladder of my carrer, and I think your school is a good choice to achieve this. I hope I have fully replied to all your questions, don't hesitate to contact me if you want me to deepen any of these points. Best regards Arno G.\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

But no woman has been president or even prime minister for the moment. The CEOs of the biggest companies are men only. And the salary gap between men and women is still a reality.

A new law forbid smoking in public areas, bars and restaurants since a few years. At the beginning, I thought: &quot;well, no one will respect it!&quot;, but finally, this law is respected and is a real good thing. As a smoker, it is true that it is less friendly to go outside each time you want to smoke but it is much better for the health, the air and smell in bars are more pleasant and your are saving money when smoking less! With this back view point, I really think this is a good law for everyone. However, I am sometimes upset with people that are arguing because you are smoking on a terrace. Come on guys, that's the last place where we can smoke without being crammed together like pariah!\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Conclusions: - Not enough market research were carried out, before launching. - According to general opinion: we have a good idea but a bad execution. - We were not enough aware of the diversity of styles and tastes in different parts of the world.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      In my country, France, what I know about crime might be a widespread prejudice regarding the three partners: delinquents, police, Justice. - Delinquents are younger and younger. As the law does not plan the arrest of children, young offenders use their brothers to commit petty crimes such as purse snapping. Small brothers, a movie by Jacques Doillon, showed it a few years ago. Moreover, delinquents are armed. Arms dealing started during the Bosnian war in 1991 and weapons circulate almost freely in our suburbs. - The police complain about the fact that when they arrest a well-known culprit the justice releases him immediately. They prefer the old time when they fought against criminality: godfathers had laws and were less unpredictable than young individualistic men. Being a policeman is nowadays a very dangerous job. Some districts in our suburbs are in state of civil war with victims in both sides. - The justice tries to find a compromise between protecting the society and not encouraging recidivism. Judges know that jails are a breeding ground for terrorism. They also know that French prisons are incriminated by Amnesty International for their state: they are too small, overcrowded, too dilapidated. Moreover, you find in jail some people who are mentally ill and need medical care.%% (cf Dr Vronique Vasseur)\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      To become a successful leader, you have to work hard to get as much knowledges as possible : you have not to be an expert in all fields, it's naturally impossible, but you must own a minimum of knowledges to have a large vision of your departments. In a very fierce and worldwide competition, you must arbitrate and do choices, and it's not always easy. If you pay too little wages, the staff is no longer motivated and you aren't attractive for the more skilled applicants, but on the contrary, rewarding too much prevents you from staying competitive. You must keep doing agreements. That's why you have to own or to get very strong personnal qualities : you must always adopt the appropriate behaviour : be stern or sympathetic according to the situation. A leader depends on his staff to succeed : he must have a strong team spirit, and own strong skills of analysis and synthesis.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

You never update the database and that's an important point of your job. Your colleagues have to do it for you! At the same post, they do have enough time to do their own work, and a part of yours! Then, you have too be more professionnal and tidy: It's always very difficult for your colleagues to find the dossier they need if you have worked on it. That's a great lost of time for everyone. You don't communicate enough with them. You really have to change quickly all these points. We'll have an appointment with you in two weeks to see if your work is better.

In a couple, women often take care of the day-to-day work as well as caring after the children which is considered less valued than men do. Furthermore, men earned more than women, and more than than 25% of jobs taken by French women are only part time. There are some women in business and politics but they have not the same privileges.

Boris Yelnikoff ( Larry David ) is a bitter chess teacher and a former Columbia professor who made a complete mess of everything: his marriage, his Nobel prize and even his suicide. He eschews human contact except for his friends to whom he saids that the world is complety wrong. One night, Boris comes home to find a simpleminded Mississipi runaway Melodie asks for food to him, then if she can stay the night,  his world is going to collapse...

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      I would like to express the difference between private school and public one. The main difference is independently the price of teaching, as well the way of the teaching. In public school, the schooling is free comparing private one.  Both have the choice of choosing the books they want for education. Parents think that in private school, children are more monitored and the quality of teaching is better Not only because, you pay for it but some unfortunate people can't afford it. .I disagree with that idea. For me, I think all of us have the right to be educated without thinking about the price it might be! I can understand that in some colleges the quality of students is really dreadful! Some of them are here just because it is mandatory. Compare private of public school and decide which one is better than the other one, it is a really tricky question. I haven't seen the result of the good choice in the reality. I think that in the public school, student have to work strongly enough more for themselves because if they don't to it they will flunk out their schooling. I think it is better that all student overcome their success by themselves better than to be monitored.%%\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Mr. COCHE. I'm writing you this e-mail to explain the last negotiations about our computers purchases. We met Nancy Keagan from Compunow yesterday. You know we'll need to buy more and less fifty computers for the next years. The preliminary offer was the buying of thirty five PF-30 laptops at $900 per unit and fifteen SF-36 desktops at $1100 each. The total of this preliminary offer was $48000. This bill was too high for our budget and we tried to find a better way to low this price. Nancy proposed that we chose the PF-29 laptops instead of the PF-30s. They are a little lower but Simon said they're good for we need, also their prices are too lo, they are at $600 per unit. The finally offer is easily within our budget : - thirty five PF-29 laptops at $600 each - fifteen SF-36 desktops at $1100 per unit The total amount is $37000. Then, we confirmed the purchases and Nancy offered a standard one-year service plan covers parts and labor. I think that's a good deal. I call you as soon as I receive the contract because I need you to sign it.%% Sincerely. Mr. REGNIER.\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

Indeed, experiences they live influenced them and their decisions. Also, each day is a learning for a manager who hope one day become an effective and respected leader. In my opinion, to develop leadership qualities, you have several ways. The first way consists in being a leader and to start to share your vision in persuading your staff and in earning trust of your staff. But the second way consists in being a part of the staff, a sort of manager belonging to the middle management. You will have to always keep in touch with your associates in order to set up an open environement with a logical &quot;work hard, play hard&quot;. This proximity  will be perfect to earning trust exactly  as the leader of a company and maybe even better I guess. Moreover, the advantage of this second method is the legitimity of the manager who know personaly everybody in the company and what they want.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      In the past I used to be very stressed all the times because I was always overwhelmed. My boss gave me more than I could do, and he always pushed me out of my limits. It was just a nightmare situation, consequently I had a burnout. The effects of this disease were a big chronic headache, a constant pain in my throat and my back. Furthermore, I was shivering and I was feeling totally frazzled with no energy. I was trying to overcome that with practicing some exercises but I didn't succeed so much. In addition, I felt depressed. It is a dreadful situation when you have the feeling that nothing could be done differently and that it will never end. I know that nowadays companies tend to go on in that way, I guess it will be always like that. In my future job, now I don't want to be stressed anymore. In the case of it might happened, I promise that I do not want to be as I was anymore. I realized that my health and my family are the most important things in my life. All of them need me more than an employer.\r\r\n","level":"C2"}

When I was young, the learning of english was very light at school. Later, I improved my practice of english during travels in Europe. During my medicine studies, we never had any english course. I think it was a mistake.  When I went to work as a doctor, I had a lot of difficulties to read english or american medical papers. I had to work by myself to improve my understanding of this language. A few years ago, I became president of a french association. My need of english became important to attent in some international congress. I started to work more seriously my practice of english by several ways : courses on the web, reading, learning vocabulary, etc. Today, I am proud to be in &quot;intermediate sup&quot; level at Englishtown school.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      I remember when I growing up, I liked reading anything : newspaper; novels; travel magazines; and my favorite, historical fiction. At the time, books was printed exclusively on paper. So, it was necessary to move in library or bookshop in order to procure things to read. What the pride I felt at having on my shelves all the books I'd read. In the past, every day, all the membres of my family watched black and white TV together. We couldn't choose our program because there was a single channel. One day in the 1985s, my parents decided to buy a color TV. What delight to have this modern device. In the same time, I was pretty sad to give up our old TV. Somewhere along the way, Internet became more and more an important communication media. So, I've started to read news online with my laptop. Now, thanks to my Kindle, I can read absolutely anything I like into it. In my opinion, this new technology make reading even more relaxing.

Sometimes, when the manager asks them to execute a work, they dont want to do it. If the boss gives a sanction, they go on strike. Thats the big problem. There is maybe a solution: The rule must be well-defined and right written. When the company hires a new worker, she has to inform people. If any one doesnt respect the contract, he will be fired. The boss and the managers will take time to think before meeting. A report will be written to describe the rules, the tasks, and the responsibility for doing a part of work. Maybe the work will be better done.\r\r\n","level":"A2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      As an engineer, I will have to be a leader one day. Therefore, I should improve my leadership qualities to be ready for that. Developing leadership qualities is a tough problem. I will dwell on few methods to develop these skills. First and foremost, to be an efficient leader, you should have great people skills, mostly to be respected and listenning. For example, when I was 18, my biology teacher was too strict and a little mean. Therefore, my classmates and I didn't want to work. This class was not efficient. Secondly, you should have clear managing methods. For example, when I was 21, I worked on a project with three friends. One of them always organized our meetings with 3 or 4 steps. Thanks to him, we were very efficient and we wasted no time. On the whole, you should be at ease with your team, to be understand and accepted as the chief. Moreover, you have to make the team efficient with methods and an orgnization. In my opinion, if you cannot develop your people skills, you should not be a leader. It will be more difficult to obtain respect from your employees and the team will be less efficient.%%\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

So with this book, the dilemma of 'is it a good idea to change my career path?' seems more normal. Furthermore, the author gives some keys to do it and she summarizes this approach into 2 steps:  - Learn to know what is our real personnality, our hobbies, what is important for us in our work, - Then, find a job that matches up with our wishes. However, it can appear a little bit too simple... and unrealistic. In my view, it is also important to really understant why you want to change your career path.

Second, for table manner: - Do not give handkerchiefs, anything black, yellow flowers or chrysanthemums as gift when invited for dinner. - Wait to be shown where to sit. - The oldest person should sit first. - Pass dishes with both hands. - The most common utensils are chopsticks and a flat spoon. - Meals are typically served family-style. - Cover your mouth when using a toothpick.

I have to admire his excellent speaking ability when he reminded us how an important mediation was a necessity to win the interest of children. Then if he hadn't spent 30 minutes talking about the budget, the presentation wouldn't have been so boring. I'd  have liked more details about the schedule and the rules we have to respect. Fortunately he handed over to other partners and to the booksellers of the city who were very precise about on the choices that we could buy: only fiction books published less than 3 years ago. They finished by describing the conditions of making a shop window for each bookshop. Finally there was no time any more for questions so the presenter gave us the address of a website where we could find a summary of each key points.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

The costumes and the background are designed with a rock inspiration. The choreography is really impressive with the 14 oil drums position in arc. So, all these elements make the performance is really unique .It's not a coincidence that they perform their music all over the world and they are now a world-renowned band. But they don't forget their origin and they often play in the city where they began 25 years ago.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Green energy is one of the major issues of this decade, or even of this century. In fact, with the world population growing at such a high pace, energy needs are increasing exponentially. We're now trying to replace nuclear and coil power by wind and solar power to get to a more sustainable world. That's what we call &quot;green business&quot;. My opinion about green energy is that it is necessary to start using them massively, in order to preserve the Earth for the future generations of humans and animals that will receive the legacy we will give them. However, hypocritical measures are taken by governments and companies to give the impression that they are acting in that way, while they are doing only the very requiered things. I'm not really going out of my way to buy green products, because they're often too expensive, but I try to act every day in order to reduce waste. For instance I reuse plastic bottles, I buy products in biggest quantities to avoid getting many little packages, and I recycle paper and glass.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

Unfortunately public universities have not enough resources to manage all these students. Beside the education in public universities is very tough, to succeed in these universities the students have to do a lot of work.

Another thing I find wrong is that the fine to pay depends on who is the violator, for example, if is the president who is making the infraction, he won't pay anything or he will get a discount, by the other side, if is somebody like me, I'm going to prison and I have to pay a several fine. I think the results are the same even if I or the president are the law's violator. People are afraid because the laws are not equalities on each side.\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

Several persons were presented at the meeting: the CEO, the CFO, and the COO. Firstly, to introduce, the goals are to be more competitive face of the globalization and diversify our activities in order to sensitize other clients and obtain other market share. However, the CFO, CEO and COO agreed it but they asked me with which budget. So I told them that would be the next step. Secondly, we talked about the strenghts and weaknesses: the location of the company and the possibility to mege with another company in order to be more strong. Finally, The CFO didn't have time enough and told us to take couple of time for thinking about it and schedule a next meeting for developing our ideas.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

The author has certainly a lot of good intentions but I can't help thinking choices in one's personal life and career path are not so easy. I'm very positive about the idea to find a job suited to one's personality. Some people found it at the beginning of their career, others have to wait before knowing what they really want or what they are deep down into themselves. As a matter of fact, it's often depending of the uncertainties of life or opportunities you get. It's nevertheless true that trying to get to know oneself gives more self-confidence and it's stand to reason that it allows to run one's life in the most rewarding way. But it's not easy in just two simple steps as pretends the author. Life is not appallingly trite as it appears here and deserves better than simple solutions given in this book.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Our government today wants to give equality between male and female by starting a teaching to the youngest children of France which would rub the differences of sexe between them, i.e : asking : do you think a boy or a girl can do this or that? do you think boys can wear rose t-shirts and girls blue one when you were babies ? Do you think boys can play dolls, and girls can play war soldiers ?...And so on... The problem in this teaching is that it goes so far, that after they suggest to the child that his physical sex is not his gender, and that he can choose his sex. I even red that in some north countries with the same teaching, it happens that adolescent ask for operation to change of sex. This is a real problem of repair against our natural identity. This teaching has been tried in north countries like Sweden, and it appears that it didn't rub disparities between men and women yet. It is true that there are differences between male and female, but i think we have to know them ans respect each one another. It is not by inversing the sexes that we will give equality.%% I think that equality births from respect of the values of the person equally from men to women. It's the question to recognise the same value to a man and a woman, even if they are sexually different. Each creature, each person has right to the same dignity. But, it doesn't mean that a man is a women. and the alliance of both is necessary to create a family. it is a way of accepting the difference and the complementarity which creates life. It's true that most of the time, salary is not equal between male and femelle, why? Is it because it might cause absenteism for the company due to the fact of being pragnant ?

Lisa told that she was asked by a leader to be his own secretary and that she has no time left to fulfill all her job, so it's time to share the work among all the team. Evelyne gave her veto, and the meeting finished by the departure of Lisa, who felt herself unfairly understood, and she left the room, pouring some tears.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      We are going to adopt in my country a very strange law relating to the right to abort. This right was granted to women in 1976 provided their pregnancy was less than 10 weeks . Nothing else was required and in particular the position that the father may have has not been taken into consideration. It is a right that women have Some associations since 1976 have raised relevant issues following the implementation of this law . Among others the fact that the number of abortions was supposed to decrease while it remains stable at 200 000 per year or the need to properly inform those who have decided to abort about all the aspects of an abortion. Now our new government wants to adopt a law that will forbid any kind of information which could be considered as 'against abortion' , typically some websites , family advisors or even priests . Apparently authorities are fearing a new position of a significant part of the population who consider that we have gone to far as basically we can do almost anything that we want with the 1976 law and its subsequent amendments.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      In France, you should have pass the high school diploma called &quot;Baccalaurat&quot; before studying at university. I'm against that because if someone is motivated enough to study a subject, he could succeed in - even though his first experience in high school was not good. Moreover, the university is one of the last way to have &quot;free courses&quot;. Our education system is getting more and more expensive, and I'm totally against that. Especially because when students pay for some courses, they think about finding a job easily. But sometimes, they don't, and they have a lend to pay to the bank. By now, education system is becoming such as firms. One of the disadvantage is that it creates a bigger gap between wealthy and high-educated (in terms of diploma) peole and people with less money. University will help to take time to figure out who you are, what you like studying and what do you want to do in your life. The generally trend for students who study at university is taking a part-time job for paying thei daily life. The benefit from the university is the schedule : you can study whatever you want.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      One thing seems clear: Successful people are passionate people. It might be that someone is passionate about money, someone else might be passionate about helping others, but the type of motivation isn't all that important. The important lesson here is that successful people have an objective, a target, an idea or a dream that they work toward and feel passionate about. They're not just thinking about today; they're not just thinking about tomorrow; they're thinking about the rest of their lives, and who they want to be. Successful people prioritize their lives to reach their goals, spending their time on what's important for achieving their dreams. This focus can have negative effects. Focusing solely on one important thing can lead to you losing focus on other things, like family, relationships, a social life and hobbies. And if things go wrong in the one thing you're focusing on, then what's left? To be brutally honest, there's nothing left. This is the chance many successful people take. Their very drive can cause them to risk everything that they have.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

There isn't much of a beat, to my mind the melody is a little too repetitive. But it was just my opinion. The song has kind of a sentimental melody. The singer doesn't have much of a range, that say he hits some really low and high notes. The song has a rough, wild sound with a tune that is pretty catchy. I'm not really sure to recommend this song, at least, not to everybody. Personally, I didn't enjoyed it.\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      In France, gender equality is a main topic. Why&nbsp;? Because in my country, women has always been fighting for their rights. For instance, there was a huge movment of feminism in the 40's with Simone de Beauvoir and so on, which allowed women to vote, exactly like men, in 1944. Thus, women wasn't only seen like mothers and cookers anymore. But nearly 70 years after, does roles really changed&nbsp;? Not completly. In fact, France has never seen a female president, but half of the minister are females. A lot of high responsabilities in business are hold by men, even if more and more women are leading key roles. Men are still having a biggest salary than woman for the same job (approximatly 12% higher), and in some professions like craftman, women are rear.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Donnie Darko directed by Richard Kelly is definitely a must-see movie ! Before his not very convincing 'The Box' based on the Richard Matheson's novel, he had conceived an unsung masterpiece. First screened incognito, it finally received a deserved acclaim once released on DVD. The great strength of the movie : mixing the genres swimmingly. We believe we are watching a thriller with a young schizophrenic inclined to murders whereas we are caught in a Gothic one. Stylized horror movie for few shots  besides, the action takes place on Halloween  while we attend to a genre movie, certainly, but a SF one. More than a mash-up, a combination of many elements or a borrowing to one genre or another, Kelly plays with frontiers. The movie becomes more than a meta-genre, it's a 'borderline' object. Beyond the psychoanalytic approach  although widely present  the word has to be taken at face value. The movie is in a perpetual balance, close to a rubbishy one because of the human sized rabbit's intervention, hero alter ego, related to his urges and came straight out of a B movie. Kelly draw his inspiration from this shared imagery and clichs which take the audience aback and make the surprise possible. Kelly transcends them. Indeed, he frees himself from frontiers to build something else. We are at the heart of the subject : the movie talks about human boundaries and getting over it, physically and mentally. Unsuspected capacities and self-denial. If you liked 'The Butterfly Effect', we would become familiar with his father : 'Donnie Darko'.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

In France, like in other countries, when you are invited at someone's or somewhere, for dinner, or an other special occasion, there are some rules that you have to respect. First, don't be late, or too late: when you are invited at someone's place, the best is to arrived few minutes after the scheduled hour, but not more than fifteen minutes. If you are going to an event, like, let's say, in an Art Gallery, for some kind of event, just be at time, or five minutes late. Then, an other advice is to bring something, a little present, when you're invited for dinner somewhere (except if you're going to the restaurant). The most common things are a bouquet of flowers, or a bottle of wine, but other things are also appreciated, like some special food, to taste at the aperitif. Of course, in all cases, turn off your phone before going to your invitation, because it is ill-considered, and very rude. Then, when comes the time of start eating, wait for everybody to be served before starting, it's respectful.%% Well, now you're ready to spend a good time at your next invitation. Last step : book a flight to France to taste some nice food !\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

The plot is quite simply : Robert Downey as Tony Sark is a playboy, genius head of Stark Industries. After he has captured an ambush, he used his intelligence for built weapon and hight-tech suit to escape. This dangerous plot was resolved by the new Iron Man.The super hero is commontopic, but the super hero theme is universal. Robert Downey Jr excels in his Stark's role, but when there are stunts, he's over-the top. Overall, it's amazing! Two trumbs up! Movie must see!\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

The main evidence is that many articles and TV report still devoted to this issue. They all point out that for the same job women still earn nearly 20 percent less than men. Even if the place of the women is no longer at home raising a family as her husband went out to work, she remains the one who puts her career enters bracket to rise children when she cant afford to pay a nanny.

Hiro Takashi, a Japanese scientist, has worked on anthropomorphic robots that play an important role as mobile escort robots. It helps to carry out dangerous work in an effective time manner. Hiro predicts to finish this project in 5 years with improvement of facial expression like sadness and happiness. Emotional intelligence seems to be the same goal for these 3 teams in making a perfect robot. Hiro's procedure requires a shortest time to accomplish compared to Bonnie's ( 10 years) and Major Pettegrew's ( by 2050). While Bonnie wants to make her robots serviceable in Medicine and Health, like doing hospital cleaning at the first time and then taking care and sharing patient's suffering, Major Pettigrew develops industrial ones to replace stressful work in agriculture or in security like robot dogs. As he believed, these will become a next generation of heros and a team of emotional human-like robots.\r\r\n","level":"C2"}

He spoke well, his elocution was calm, clear and he knew how to stress on the key points without to be heavy. The short movie in the middle, was a very good idea. This presentation of our recent success projects was funny. This interlude allowed to change our mind and in the same time, it gave us a lot of information.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Dear Pam, Before your long travel in France, let me give you some information about manners and etiquette in our country. First, in Paris, people is very busy. So, you'll be invited a long time ago, but you should answer ASAP. When you arrive to a dinner party, you are expected to bring a small gift. Traditionally, it's a bottle of red wine. Otherwise, you could come with a bottle of champagne, which will be drunk at the aperitif for a small dinner without to much people. For a big birthday party, the champagne will be drunk later with the cake.  You know, since a couple of years, there is a new kind of invitation everywhere in France. It's called &quot;apero-dinatoire&quot;, not only an aperitif, not really a dinner. You'll not be seated around a table. You'll be invited earlier. And for the meal, you will have a lot of small plates with different kind of food like &quot;tapas&quot; in spain. Concerning the other social codes and the manners for a dinner, I guess it's the same than in your country : speak with everybody, let the hostess place you around the table, waiting for her before beginning to eat, put the napkin on your lap, waiting for the men to serve the wine, congratulate your hosts for the meal, send to the hostess a mail or a SMS the day after the dinner to thank her .%%..

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      My hubsband and I are lucky enough to own our own home. We have good jobs and a solid credit history. When my father died, he left me some money and we used that as a down payment on a home loan. I feel very fortunate. Before looking for a home, we had to sit down with a mortgage broker. We needed to be 'pre-approved' for a loan so we could actually make an offer on a home if we found one. The process was very complicated, requiring an incredible amount of paperwork. When we were finally ready to start looking, we contacted a real estate broker. He showed us more than 15 homes. Once or twice we found a home that we liked, but before we had a chance to consider making an offer, the home was gone, purchased by someone else. We finally found a lovely home in our price range and our offer was accepted. Looking back, it was far from easy, but owning our own home makes all the trouble well worth it.\r\r\n","level":"C2"}

One day, as we were cooking in the little chalet, suddenly the electricity went off and we found no way to make it start again. So we went out, to the house of our housekeeper not far away obviously. When we arrived, I tried to explain in english what was happening and I said : Plums (meaning &quot;les plombs&quot; in french) are off in our chalet.She looked at us and said : &quot;plums&quot; oh OK, no problem. She got round her house, took a little stepladder and told us to follow her. So we had a walk for about 10 minutes. We arrived into a field, she found a tree, put the ladder below and show us out to collect plums that were on it.

Furthermore, did you know that the dodo was an endemic bird and the national emblem to the Republic of Mauritius? Its appearance was big and almost cubic, it was more like a turkey, with small wings, therefore unable to fly. It had small yellow feet and a big hooked beak. Nowadays, scientists agree, after many studies to say it was herbivore, but vorace and it could be very agressive sometimes. Besides, during my research I have learned it had been eradicated by the actions of humans. I have attached some pictures that I found at the time of my research. I hope you will be interested on it, and I'm looking forward to seeing you to discuss about that. Sincerely, Anna\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

Before you leave, please take  attention to a few words I would like to say as your colleague and friend.First, you should consider the human aspect of the job you want to leave. You belong to a friendly team and your departure will destabilize all of us. For many years we are working together, and we would have helped you to face your problem, if you had asked us.Secondly, I think you can't avoid your phobia any longer, because confined spaces are everywhere. You will be confronted with the same problem all your life if you don't try to control you phobia. I can imagine that you are fed up with those unpleasant symptoms: sweating, shaking,  feeling oppressed every morning must be painful. But you should try the cognitive behavioral therapy: a medical professional would explain  you how to breath when you're in  panic. And if this were  not sufficient, some medications can help you.I hope sincerely you will change your mind and stay with us.Best wishes,A.H\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      In my opinion green business is definitely one new way of doing business. That's a new type of business that impacts us in our daily life. It is both a new tool from marketing point of view and an intelligent way how to preserve all natural ressources. But I personaly consider that people are too much manipulated. When watching TV, we are given so many information regarding new products, new brands that, in the end, we are almost obliged to buy some of those green products. Some people even if they can't afford buying them will sacrifice some other things in their life in order to be a member of I call &quot; the green community&quot;. Marketing concept has created new needs to people. On the other hand I need to admit that, yes, natural ressources are geeting scarce. It's a just a fact we can not ignore it at all. We all know that the worlwide population is drastically increasing. The earth will have to do more to feed that population but we all know that our planete is already under capacity. In that sense, the green industry is doing its part by providing some solutions such as recycling old products, reducing any kind of waste.%% One good example is the recycling of old clothes into new materials to create new products.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

Furthermore, it is a good way to avoid losing valuable time in the supermarkets, especially when you have to wait in a queue, and the costs of delivery are offset by the fact you do not have to go to the shops, using your car and so, some fuel. The design of the website is quite attractive with pictures of all the types of food you can buy and the use of modern light colors. All is well understandable, with the description of each product, their current price, the best season to eat them, their weight, their expiry date...Moreover you can choose between various types of delivery methods, at your home, in a dedicated shop closed to your address or at your work.%% Nevertheless, you have to be available in a range of two hours that you must select when you place your order.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      In the UK, even in this day and age, table manners are considered important. This applied even more when you're eating in the formal situation at someone's house. First of all, if you have any special diet requirements, your hsots will expect to be told about them in advance. Do not spring any last minute surprises. Take a small gift whith you. A bottle of wine, flowers or chocolates are all acceptable. Wait until your host begin eating, they sai it's okay for you to do so; this shows that you are considerate. Don't make phone calls or sends text messages while you re at the table. It's considered extremely bad manners. When it comes to cutlery, the soup spoon is generally on the right, to the outside of kinfe; the fork in on the left; and dessert spoon is above the dinner plate. However, if you are not sure which of silverware to use, you can employ a strategy I use myself when a similar situations: whatch what others do, and the do that, too.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      First and foremost, France still has nowadays obvious problems about gender equality in its society. Government is working on some solutions to decrease the biggest differences we can meet between gender rights. For example, women don't get the same salary than men yet. In addition, when we talk about families problems, there aren't such any solutions for the victim, as a woman. Women don't have a lot of choices to defend themselves. On the other hand, whithout talking about equal rights through society, the values are very different. I mean you can meet all sorts of opinions when you talk with a man, about the way he communicates, he's polite or he guesses woman's needs. Whereas talking with a woman can be a different approach to see relationships. To condlude, like in the most of countries now, time have changed. But I think we have to think about all possibilities you have to talk and communication whith each other, and understand (or try to) other's opinion.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Being polite must be taking care of the others but too much people are selfish and certainly tired. People who live in the South of the country are more relax, more polite.

That said, I recently heard about the promulgation of a law to ban beauty contests for children. It's quite complicated (the story with the Senate and the National Assembly), but if I got the point, it would seem that it's now officially a felony to organise this kind of contest for children. The organisers bay be sentenced to a prison term of two years, and a 30 000 euros fine. If you ask me, I think it's a good idea. Society doesn't need this kind of show. Otherwise, we teach to young girls that their appearance is their best skill, and this is extremely reductive. In case of victory, the winning girl turns into a little princess with a outsized ego.

I am very well aware of the problems all of us have here: class furniture is in a deplorable condition, the food served at the cafeteria is expensive and tastes bad. We have fewer and fewer field trips because of insufficient funding and allocations have been made to departments that did not need them. Last year, summer classes were postponed at the last moment because of lack of maths and history teachers. Together, we will resolve all these burning issues. I believe that together we can change things. The student council and its President are answerable to the student body and I promise that if I am elected as President, I will ensure a close liaison between you and the council and together we will vote a priority list and determine together how we should act. I look forward to seeing you next sunday and make the right choice: Vote for Sarah.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

Is interesting to understand what could justify this difference. There's two items who justify it : the pregnancy and the life expectancy. Women can be pregnant, and then stop to work for few month, and still get paid. On the other hand, statistics show that women live more longer than men, so they are longer retired. Furthermore, in a company, it's not really usual to have a woman as a CEO, perhaps the possible pregnancy explain it either. Isn't it difficult to have his CEO away for her maternity ? The gender equality in a company, as in the french society is still a challenge.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      In my studies I used to make many presentations in english and spanish. I remember a presentation in english that I made with a colleague, this presentation was about rugby and british identity. I was in charge of the describing part of the differents rugby teams in Great Britain. I explained the history of each team, the symbols and the anthems. My colleague made the part that describes how rugby can reflect the british identity. Her part was more general than my mine. At the end we concluded that as French people we could believe that rugby has an important place in Great Britain but in reality football is most famous, in fact like in France. For this presentation we had good points, we made great slides with pictures and sound, we spoke clearly without reading our notes but we had also bad points, we didn't have time to review our presentation together and there was a bit too long for our teacher. To conclude this presentation was not perfect but I learnt a lot about rugby and it was the only grade for the course of British Civilization and I passed it.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Sometimes I got hooked on a graphic novel, and I could'nt put it down till I'd finished it. I was constantly reading. Literature, novel, historic fiction, romance, biography. These days, I don't read anymore because of a buzz of activity. I only find the time for news. I bought my first computer in the 90's and I have a smartphone. There are many kinds of media in the modern world. Information is everywhere. Communications media includes TV, newspapers and the web. However, I'm not keen on TV. I find my trade publications online to keep on top of business news. Nowadays, you can get any information on demand but if you are looking people in the street, they have all the eyes on the screen. They are all engrossed by a tablet or a smartphone. Technology is unstopable. I understand that it's exciting playing on the screen or getting information or messages but I think we lost something. We can't find a bookshop anymore because of the internet.%%\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

In my opinion, the second point is to share a vision with your team. If you don't, your team won't be drive very long... An other point is your ability to accept criticism. Persuading each one in your team is great, but it's better if you do it after listening the differents opinions about projects and goals. At this list, I would like to add the ability to delegate.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      There is a fair amount of risks to starting a new business. The most important thing that you can do to make your business successful, is to make sure you have a plan. A business plan will make sure that you are clear on what is it that you are trying to accomplish, and how you are planning to do it. This will keep you focused, and ensure that you don't get sidetracked. It is a good idea to go back and look at your business plan from time to time, to see how closely you are following it. A second key to having a successful business, is that you have to know what is it that you are selling. What you have to know is what makes your product different from your competitors, and why a customer would want your product. This brings us to the next key to business success, which is having an effective market plan. The biggest challenge for most companies is finding customers, so you have to make sure that you have a place for doing it.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Terms of reference This report presents the results of a survey about general employee satisfaction at Hays and Sons. Procedure About 10% of the total employees have answered the survey which represents a good sample in terms of age, sex and cultural background.  Findings Most people are happy about the employee basic package. However they deplore the overtime culture. They are regularly expected to work around the clock and are never rewarded. Most employees are satisfied with the employee advanced package but think that two years to be eligible is too long. Conclusions Hays and Sons employees are generally satisfied with their working conditions but some points might be improved. Recommendations In order to improve the working environment we suggest that the company rewards staff in some way when they work overtime. Another way to meet higher satisfaction would be to shorten the time before being eligible to the employee advanced package.%% 18 months seem to be a more realistic period.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Indeed, it has been one of the most hilarious moment in my life, especially when my father ordered his food! The waiter had pronounced the usual sentences such as &quot;small, medium or big&quot; about the size of the drink when my father answered &quot;a normal one please&quot;...Then the waiter asked if my father would like some potatoes or french fries. Obviously, for him there was no difference between a potatoe and a french frie so he responded &quot;whatever you want&quot;...Finally, the waiter finished by asking if we would like to eat-in or take-out. Of course, my father did not answer as expected by saying &quot;it is for now&quot;. I am not sure that the waiter found this dialogue very funny, given that my father did not joke, he was serious. Actually, I guess the waiter had a good sense of humour to remain calm. Clearly, my parents did not used to eat in fast food and I think they never went to a restaurant like that from this time. But it's still a good moment of hilarity, each time we remind this scene!%%\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      The graph shows the trends of the National and International sales figures during five years between 2004 to 2008. First of all, if we look at the period between 2004 to 2005 we can follow the trends of the sales in these two developping markets : National and International. International sales figures increased sharply from 2004 to 2005. From 2005 until 2007, sales levelled off. Then, there was a small decrease in the end of the 2007 . Finally the sales remained constant even after 2008. The trends of the National sales figures was quite identical with some differences. From 2006, the sales focused on a significant rise with a very big increase in turnover. In conclusion, I would like to say that we should concentrate our efforts in the National Market and keep on investing in the International Market to go up the gains we made two years ago.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Success is often associated with financial and social success. The image that comes to my mind when I think of success is a hard-working and busy businessman, who is very rich and respected by people. I imagine a man who runs behind schedule but who has the time to show his wonderful and elegant woman during fashionable evenings. Businessmen are respected because they embody the power. On the contrary, a spiritual person like Soeur Emmanuelle, who owned nothing, was admirable because she was herself and made us aware of the essential things. I consider that Soeur Emmanuelle succeeded her personal life because she remained faithful to herself and to her deepest aspirations. She found the meaning of her life by believing in God and by helping the most needy. However, you can find some similarities between these two examples. The businessman and the spiritual person both have a goal and do their best to reach it. They both have qualities and skills that lead them to success like intelligence, a great involvement in what they do, an extraordinary strength of character and perseverance. Despite these similarities, I cant help thinking that the businessman is just gifted like thousands of businessmen whereas Soeur Emmanuelle is an exceptional human being.%%\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      I have studied during one year in Netherlands and the difference with the French system and really striking. Firstly, the amount of class hours by week is quite different. In France the number of hours of seminars and lectures combined are around to 25-30 hours. Whereas in Netherlands we just had seminars of 10-15 hours by week. It really felt different to me, I had the feeling at that time that we did not really work and even get to the moment when I had nothing to do. Secondly, what really strikes me is the relation that students had with their respectives teachers. In France, the relation student-teacher is quite vertical. On the other hand in Netherlands the relationship was more friendly. Students could go out of the class or even answered their phone which is totally forbidden in France. To conclude, I would say that education in Netherlands is more practical, vocational whereas in France we're stressing a lot about theoritical's aspect.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

That is when the goverment reacts, when the trade ain't fair.  I have example, like mc donalds, which killed a young boy with one of its burgers. They had to pay the price of his death. But again, i have questions because if mc donalds burgers could kill, why are mc donalds restaurents still open. It's not like it happened once or twice. And shareholders must pay to, for giving money to allow those poisoned burgers to be prepar and sell. But how can you juge the juge? And the way meats are provided oh my lord, you give mc donalds to a starving asian or afrikan they would die. Same for coca cola, but what can we do.

It was so alarming to describe the absolutely predicament whose two German soldiers were to tackle with. As long as they have had to living, therefore they were remembering about this unbelievable mistake. Unfortunately for them, the miscalculation being human, anyway. By the time, these two pilots of the Luftwaffe's aircraft were flying and tried to pick out hostile's cruisers from North Atlantic ocean. Suddenly in this way, they noticed ships which were sailing over their planes and they were such utterly convincing to overlook the Britain's enemies. With diligently manner, they hugely bombarded onto them, then the boats sunk after this nasty strike. After that, they came back right away very proud at home. However, the most incredible thing happened to learn that they have been destroyed two of the best devices's war of the German navy. Everything happened really fast, thus maybe the two German pilots have not received the golden medal of war for their heroic mission.\r\r\n","level":"C1"}
{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Last week, I ate in a small restaurant in the downtown of my city, Strasbourg, France. The place is very small and not quiet at the lunch time, because it's a take-away restaurant too. The reason why I choose it is that it offers Mediterranean food. All recipes were colourful, flavoured and tasteful like in the South of France. They were served in small portions in order you can have a lot of them, from the appetizer to the dessert, without feeling too heavy at the end of the meal. What is interesting too in this concept is that it is a deli too where you can buy all of the typical ingredients of the dishes. And with the loyalty card, you can invite your friends to discover it or offer them some food gifts like a carton of amarena cherries or a bottle of balsamic vinegar. Finally, this restaurant is the place to go to discover the Mediterranean food step by step, firstly at the table of the restaurant and endly by cooking at home.\r\r\n","level":"B1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Roles do males and females have changed a lot since fifty years. 50 years ago, women stayed at home, they didn't work outside. Women had to cook and take care about their family. Whereas men won money to provide the family's need. Gradually things have changed, women have begun work outside. What women can do in business ? Nothing ? This had to be difficult for women to integrate themselves into the working world. Now, this is maybe still difficult. Women are still less paid than men, there are still differences between men and women. Now days men still like win money for the family and be the &quot;boss&quot; at home.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Good evening, Robots are used in the industries to do some hard human tasks. For example, in the car industry, workers are replaced by robots. AI is used more and more in the medicine, to help patients to follow their treatment. Mobiles phones and new applications give people instantly some practical information, like to find the best restaurant in my town, to know the best journey to go to the airport, Mobiles phone has too a function of road travel. The laptop permits me to send emails, to watch videos, to share photos, to listen new music. I think certain innovations are really positive for the human. But if the scientists create innovations to make war or to invent some new weapons, its maybe dissuasive but it gives the possibility to destroy the world. And I think, its very dangerous because men can become mad. So Im sometimes skeptical about certain robotic inventions. But we couldnt stop the progress for the better, I hope.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      I am optimistic and pessimistic the same time about our future. I am optimistic regarding the technological progress because I am shore that technology will facilitate our day to day life. I work in an relevant field (new technologies) and I have the opportunity to observe the continuous progress of technology. I remain pessimistic because of air pollution and population growth. World population is growing too fast compared with natural resources and we are obliged to produce more in order to insure the daily necessities. Every production process requires more energy consumption and more industrial waste and all this actions will increase pollution and will impact our air quality. I really hope that this situation will improve and my children will live in a clean environment.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      For a few years, road safety rules have become much more strict in France. If someone overpasses the permitted speed when being caught by speed cameras, he loses automatically driving licence points and must pay a fine. In case where the overspeeding is to high - above 50 km\/ h- , he goes to the court and is charged with felony which can brings him to jail. In my view, the laws were too lenient before. Too many drivers were reckless and were used to drive incredibly fast endangering other drivers and pedestrians. From a political point of view, being more tough with the car drivers is never popular. It's not the best way to curry favour with voters. But, from a safety standpoint, it was probably a good idea that I support.To my mind, the advantages outweigh the downsides. Some people say, It's an infringement on individual freedoms. Maybee. But about 2000 lives have been saved every year since the law passed, so it worth the disadvantages. If you ask me, making law is a complicated business. It's impossible to make everybody happy.The point is not to choose between the good and the evil, but to determine the less evil.%% This new regulation did.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      The Court Green burglar arrested A 23 years old man was arrested at 6am in connection with the series of burglaries in and around Court Green that had been taking place over the past 15 months. The suspect's name has not been released yet. The police had made every effort to catch the burglar, such as increasing the police patrols in the area, setting up undercover surveillance, having a publicity campaign published in this local paper, and promising a $300 reward for information. John White, police lieutenant, confirmed that people felt concerned by these efforts and were willing to help the police. Thanks to a local resident who saw somebody acting suspiciously in the neighbourhood, the police patrolling nearby managed to give chase to the suspect and eventually cornered him in Hamilton Road at 6am. The man is currently being held in custody for police questioning and is bound to be charged for the crimes by the end of tomorrow. James Denver, a Court Green inhabitant, reported he felt greatly relieved to know that the burglar had been arrested. \r\r\n","level":"C2"}

It is not a good opportunity for the unemployed who will be underpaid and suffer from substandard labor practices. Furthermore, my parents own their grocery shop and they will inevitably have to sell before they go bankrupt. Actually, it is a fact that businesses which have been running for generations usually close down after the opening of a new Super Mart in the neighborhood.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      When I decided to learn and to play classical music I knew that I couldn't waste time anymore. I learned piano very young and when I was twelve years old I changed for the classical guitar. That was deadly serious, studying a lot and performing later. I had a hard time but I never wasted time worrying and never gave up. What does matter, though, is that I became a professional and performed in concert. Every day was important and I learned how to maximize each one. Every musical piece is important and I do play as if it were my last music. The classical music repertory is way too large to all play and people who like this music is huge. I have to do my best to make people happy or to motivate others about this music. That sounds great to me because I found what works for me and I want badly to share with the most of people. If I should give an advice to young musicians, it'd be : work hard, don't waste time and never give up - what does matter is that you show your generosity and your feeling through your music.%%\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

Learning English was a chore except during the last year with a young American lecteur, hired to speak with us (to speak, not only to listen or try to learn by heart irregular verbs!). Now I wonder how it was possible to make it boring.  The language teaching in France is a pure scandal! I should say was because young people seem as gifted now as young German or Norwegian. Anyway I am ashamed to admit that I followed the scandalous example of my teachers. When I was 21, I went to Algeria as volunteer. There I was supposed to get a position of primary school teacher. The inspector found out that my mother had an American name so he decided that I could teach English. I accepted just because there were less hours in the college than in the primary level.

This start was a success with a sharp rise during the first year of activity. Revenues had reached one million pounds at the beginning of 2005 for national sales and two millions for international ones, thus exceeding the original business plan.In 2005, national figures remained stable while international sales grew steadily during the first six months and then fell dramatically. From 2006 to now, international figures have never recovered any progression and even faced another sudden fall in 2007.

Of course, I know you suffer a lot because your family has never been by your side to help and support you in your childhood. However, you will make a big mistake if you decide to continue shoplifting and other petty crimes! You had better not stay with your new &quot;friends&quot; because they will always have a bad influence on you. Furthermore, if you do not change your behavior now, you will likely to be arrested as an adult and the consequences will not be the same! The environment in jail is much more dangerous than in your juvenile detention, not sure you would be able to face with it as easily as in the past. So, I urge you to think twice before continuing in this way, even if you think it is the best solution for you. Moreover, do not hesitate to ask me if you are looking for an accomodation or help to persist in your schooling. Be sure I will do all I can to help you in this way, and I encourage you again to stop playing with fire, as long as it is still possible.%% Take care. Franck\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

However, it seems that your salary is lower than the previous one, so you might think about cutting some costs in every way. Here are some ideas how to save money without changing your style life. For example, try to make your own coffe at home in the morning instead to drink into a coffee shop. You can also pack your own luch by using a lunch box, this will be more cheapier and will help you to save money. As a example, when you buy your lunch into a sandwich shop you spend at least $50 per week, when on the other hand if you prepare your own lunch box, you should spend less than $25 per week. This must sound reasonnable, isn't it ? Also reduce your activities after work, instaed getting to a restaurant with your freinds invie them at home by preparing a nutritious meal. Hope this will help you for your new style life. Best regards and wishing you all the best.%%. Ccile\r\r\n","level":"C1"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Regarding social and professional life, etiquette is still really important in France. Everybody is supposed to know some common rules as not putting elbows on the table while having lunch. But some rules are more subtle. They are a marker of social status. Many people don't realize how essential they are, or don't want to. But breaking them, can be harmful. For example, when a member of lower classes greet someone, he says 'Bonjour Monsieur Dupont&quot; whereas one of upper classes would say Bonjour Monsieur&quot; without the name. When you get into a drawing room, you have to kiss on the hand of the hostess, but not the hand of the other women who are guests. It would be very impolite. All of that could seem frivolous. It could be said: It doesn't matter. But in fact, that's not the case. It's necessary to sustain career and upward social mobility. For instance, as a partner of a law firm, I always pay attention to good manners of a candidate before hiring him, because some of our clients are extremely demanding on proper etiquette. It's a corporate identity's issue. So if I can give advice.%% You're expected to respect the customs, even if they can look like old fashioned.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      Looking to the future I could be a manager. That's why I need to learn right now how to be a good leader. In my opinion I think that to be a good leader you have to be empathetic. It's important to be able to understand your employee's feelings. If they are in a good mood, if they share your vision. It's very important if you want them to achieve your goals. And it can be very useful to defuse conflicts. An excellent people skills is also necessary for being a good leader. For instance you should be able to set some activities for improving team building. By the same time, you will be able to know better your staff and to infer their best qualities and skills. You can also to be charismatic but it's not so important for me. Last but not least a leader has to be an example for his staff. You have to prove that you are competent, full of talent. If your staff admire you, they will follow you and your vision even through hardships.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      To create a successf ul project and solid teamwork, I proprose that companies use the swot analysis technique. Swot helps a business evaluate internal and external strengts, weaknesses, oppportunities and treats. Let's say you carru out a swot analysis at the beginning of the project. The first thing is to make sure that project goals are clear. Then, I'd say you should make a list of questions to satisfy each element of the swot analysis. You want to make sure all the major project tasks are covered and identify passible risks. My thought then would be to take swot even further team members could collaborate on a swot analysis of the team itself, making them a stronger team and developing mutual trust. For example, if the team spends time identifying theit strengths, then the resulting information can actually motivate the team. And, as they identify weakneseses, they become more aware of how to prevent future problems. Once you complete a swot analysis, I suggest that you review it frenquently. Change the questions and answers as the market changes, and focus on taking advantage of your strenghts and oppportunities and reducing your weaknesses and threats.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

This has to be applied whatever you are on a formal situation as business dinner, when you are invited at friends' home or when you are simply dinning at home. First of all, you have to quickly answer to invitation if needed, whatever you forecast to participate or not. Then, good etiquette is to bring with you a gift to your host, generally a bottle of wine or flowers. When dinning, you have to respect some rules : wait until your hosts begin eating and don't speak with a mouth full. A really important rule is to avoid to make phone calls or send message texts while you are at the table. If you need to answer an important call, then apologize yourself and leave the table. After the dinner, don't forget to thank your hosts and send them a short message (whatever call or mail) to thank them again for the dinner.\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

This extremely serious question deeply divides our society and the minds aren't about to be calmed down. A few mayors refused to marry homosexual couples and they have been charged with not respecting the law. Admittedly, the laws must be put into practice by everyone, moreover by a representative of the State, but it's easier said than done. What happens when the law conflicts with your religious convictions? I mean, based on Catholicism and other religions also, only two persons of opposite sex may get married. So, what a dilemma! Who must outweigh? The citizen or the Christian?According to me, the Christian. Why? It one hand, I understand that we must struggle with all the kinds of discrimination and I totally agree that the homosexual persons must be as respected as the others; but, in the other hand, they might already officially unit their life by signing the PACS agreement. Subsequently, they don't absolutely need to get married, especially as marriage paves the way to adoption and, particularly, to the right to medical-helped procreation, which is another heavy question!%%\r\r\n","level":"B2"}

The problem is that many women are frightened to be labelled as feminist, which in their mind is synonymous of lack of femininity.

{"fulltext":"\r\r\n      I'll never forget the first car I bought. It was very small, but as a student and with beautiful little financial resources that go with, I needed it. It was a used car. The price was 20 000. I didn't have that much money, so I made an offer of 15 000. The owner made a counteroffer of 18 000. I said that I was sorry but I just didn't have the money. I also told the owner how much I loved the car and wished his good luck. I continued to look at other cars, but couldn't find anything I loved. Then, a few days later, I heard from the owney. The car was mine for 15 000. He said that he had no other offers and also needed money. I was very happy and satisfied with that car. \r\r\n","level":"B1"}
